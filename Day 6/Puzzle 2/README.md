# Guard Patrol Obstruction Placement

## Problem Description

### Challenge
Find the number of unique positions to place an obstruction that will cause the guard to get stuck in a loop.

### Key Rules
- Cannot place obstruction at guard's starting position
- Goal is to create a loop that prevents guard's normal patrol

### Visualization Criteria
- `O`: New obstruction
- `|`: Guard moves up/down
- `-`: Guard moves left/right
- `+`: Guard moves both up/down and left/right

### Example Scenarios
The problem provides 6 different positioning options demonstrating how an obstruction can trap the guard:

1. Printing press near starting position
2. Failed suit prototypes in bottom right quadrant
3. Chimney-squeeze prototype fabric near desk
4. Alchemical retroencabulator in bottom left corner
5. Retroencabulator slightly shifted right
6. Tank of sovereign glue near universal solvent tank

### Task
*Determine the total number of positions where a single new obstruction could trap the guard in a loop.*

### Example Result
In the provided scenario, there are `6` possible obstruction positions that would create a loop.
